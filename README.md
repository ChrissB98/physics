$\underline{\text{1D band model}}:$
Given a 1D toy model of a periodic lattice: $V(x)=s* E_r*\sin{(2\pi x)}^2$ with $E_r=\frac{(2\pi\hbar)^2}{2m}$ python computes the hamiltonian matrix elements on the basis of plane waves. Afterwards the energy eigenvalues are calculated and for $s\in\[1,100\]$ the evolution of the five lowest bands is shown in a matplotlib animation.
