1D_band_model.py :
Given a 1D toymodel of a periodic lattice with potential $V(x) = s \times E_r\times\sin(2*\pi*x)$ with $E_r = \frac{(2*\pi*\hbar)^2}{2m}$. Python computes the matrix elements on the basis of plane waves and calculates the eigenergies. Aftwerwards an animation is generated for s =1 - 100.
